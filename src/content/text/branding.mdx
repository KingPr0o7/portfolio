The “Nathan Parker Brand” is a personal brand created by me to label/identify my open-source software, applications, **and** experiences. As such, to protect this brand and identity, my logo is **pending trademarking**. This page will go over things like usage, logo meaning, colors, contrast, font, safe area, spacing, scaling, orientation, usage, and more.

## Logo Meaning
You might be wondering why this logo is special or has any meaning to it. *However*, to me, this logo is like the final stamp/signature of my software. I'm an open-source developer, who likes streamlined and simple experiences **for everyone to enjoy and modify**. My software is also aimed at being inviting, easy to use, and bringing people together. However, I'm not much of a designer; thus, I had the logo created and commissioned by <Link text="Softriver" href="https://www.softriver.co/" /> where I was able to explain who I am and what I do. From my explanations and other research, <Link text="Softriver" href="https://www.softriver.co/" /> found these themes about me that are reflected in the logo:

<Double>
	<div>
		- High-quality
		- Minimalistic
		- Modernity
		- Openness
		- Sleekness
	</div>
	<div>
		- Forward-looking
		- Trustworthiness
		- Dedication
		- Reliability
		- Passion
	</div>
</Double>

### Pictogram
From which the pictogram was created, with it containing the letter 'N' with the cleaver use of negative space and typographical design. It's focused on being modern and minimalistic to evoke a sense of trust and openness for the users, as it's shown to:

<Lottie id="pictogram" loop={false} />

### Wordmark
The word mark is simply my name, 'Nathan Parker', presented in the <Link text="Gilroy™" href="https://www.tinkov.info/gilroy.html" /> font made by <Link text="Radomir Tinkov" href="https://www.tinkov.info/about.html" />. With the 't' having its crossbar/cross stroke modified to reduce the spacing and increase flow between characters:

<Lottie id="wordmark" loop={false} />

## Colors
For the colors of my brand, they're based on the colors I picked for this revision of my website. These colors are applied to my logo, websites, and likely any further applications that I make. More colors might be introduced soon, but as of now, these are my current personal brand colors:

<Grid>
	<Color name="Primary" HEX="#084C9A" RGB="rgb(8, 76, 154)" />
	<Color name="Secondary" HEX="#032348" RGB="rgb(3, 35, 72)" />
	<Color name="Accent" HEX="#378CE1" RGB="rgb(55, 140, 255)" />
	<Color name="Black" HEX="#000000" RGB="rgb(0, 0, 0)" />
	<Color name="Background" HEX="#10100F" RGB="rgb(16, 16, 15)" />
	<Color name="Gray" HEX="#FFFFFF11" RGB="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.067)" />
	<Color name="White" HEX="#FFFFFF" RGB="rgb(255, 255, 255)" />
	<Color name="Off-white" HEX="#E3E3E3" RGB="rgb(227, 227, 227)" />
	<Color name="Light-gray" HEX="#B9B9B9" RGB="rgb(185, 185, 185)" />
	<Color name="Success" HEX="#37E167" RGB="rgb(55, 225, 103)" />
	<Color name="Warning" HEX="#E8ED0A" RGB="rgb(232, 237, 10)" />
	<Color name="Error" HEX="#E13737" RGB="rgb(225, 55, 55)" />
</Grid>

### Logo Colors
In terms of the logo's colors, **the only colors permitted** are ___primary___, ___accent___, ___white___, ___off-white___, and ___black___. All other colors don't fit the brand (secondary is too dark), *and thus aren't available* in the colorways or any application of my logo. Furthermore, **don't** switch up colors from the provided colorways. For example, putting the accent on top and the primary on bottom for the pictogram. Modifying the logo with different colorways or layouts of colors makes the logo harder to recognize:

<Img src={Logo_Colors} alt="Examples of wrong colorways for my logo" />

### Logo Contrast
When using my logo for thumbnails, blog posters, and other pictorial media, make sure the contrast between the logo and its background is sufficient; if not, **switch to a different colorway**. For example, my site uses off-white due to the contrast issues of the primary color. Poor contrast makes the logo harder to see and distinguish, especially at long distances:

<Img src={Logo_Contrast} alt="Ensuring sufficient contrast against the background color" />

## Font
The font for my logo and this website is <Link text="Gilroy™" href="https://www.tinkov.info/gilroy.html" /> by <Link text="Radomir Tinkov" href="https://www.tinkov.info/about.html" />. I've bought specific licensing for his font (he's a great designer), and thus you cannot use his font without purchasing a license. <Link text="Gilroy™" href="https://www.tinkov.info/gilroy.html" /> is trademarked, and if you pirate his font, you'll be infringing on his trademark. <Link text="ncp.dev" href="https://www.ncp.dev/" /> uses regular and bold along with their italic versions.

Moreover, **don't change the font of my logo**. Other fonts don't fit the design scheme of the pictogram. <Link text="Gilroy™" href="https://www.tinkov.info/gilroy.html" /> was picked due to its roundness and flow of characters. The characters in the logo are **vectors instead of text**, and changing or removing these vectors would alter the logo in many ways, including shape, flow, and spacing. If you want to change the font, use the standalone pictogram instead — ***never*** **change the font or vectors in the logo**:

<Img src={Logo_Font} alt="Example of wrong font usage within the logo" />

## Safe Area and Spacing
My logo is meant to be *visible* and *presentable* to **all**, and not just sitting on the very edge of a document or picture. Thus, there is a **defined safe area** for my logo. In addition, don't clip the word mark or pictogram when displaying my logo. Especially with the pictogram, the more clipped it is, the negative space 'N' becomes harder and harder to see or recognize.

The safe area of my logo is defined by the width of the 'N' or half of the pictogram (_if standalone_). To see this in action, please view the image below to see sufficient displacement of my logo:

<Img src={Pictogram_Specs} alt="Pictogram specification of spacing from edges of documents" />
<Img src={Logo_Specs} alt="Logo specification of spacing from edges of documents" />

I'm not *too* concerned if the logo is **exactly** pixel-perfect from each edge, but just be courteous in making my logo ___presentable___. The design is meant to be **seen**, **recognized**, and **felt**. If it's going off-screen or touching the very edge of the picture, video, or document, it makes the logo feel improper and unprofessional.

### Spacing
Furthermore, don't mess with any internal spacing or gaps in the word mark or pictogram. The logo is not designed to have any more gaps or spacing changes, as it would affect certain aspects and flow of the logo, making it appear off, or unpleasant:

<Img src={Logo_Spacing} alt="Improper spacing of the Nathan Parker logo" />

## Scaling and Orientation
When scaling the logo, make sure the logo is easily viewable. It's advised **not to use PNGs for this reason**, as scaling them down often leads to lower resolution and blurring. I've provided SVGs instead to make it easy to scale down to your needs. The minimum size is 150 PXL, and generally, you wouldn't need to go above 350 PXL. 

<Img src={Logo_Scales} alt="Logo's scaling recommendations" />

### Orientation / Rotation
In terms of the logo's orientation, don't modify how it's shown. The logo is meant to be flat (0°) and not rotated. I want the logo in all presentations to be easily **scanned**, **read**, and **understood** — the best angle for that is **0°**.

<Img src={Logo_Rotation} alt="Logo's rotation requirements showcase" />

## Logo or Pictogram Usage
Below is a basic checklist to reference when using my logo. It doesn't cover all the bases, but these are generally the most common questions or concerns that people have about using logos, especially mine:

<Implications>
	<Implication slot="good" icon="symbols/check" text="Do use my logo in a blog post or news article about myself or my software." />
	<Implication slot="good" icon="symbols/check" text="Do use my logo in a YouTube video about myself or my software." />
	<Implication slot="good" icon="symbols/check" text="Do use my logo in a livestream or podcast about myself or my software." />
	<Implication slot="good" icon="symbols/check" text="Shown to give credit to me for a service or piece of software that I helped with." />
	<Implication slot="good" icon="symbols/check" text="Shown alongside another one of my software products (e.g., Stoichify), to signal who the creator is." />
	<Implication slot="bad" icon="symbols/cross" text="Don't use my logo in a way that conveys or states that you're Nathan Parker." />
	<Implication slot="bad" icon="symbols/cross" text="Don't use my logo as an icon or logo for your business, application, product, offering, project, social media account(s), or website(s) of any kind." />
	<Implication slot="bad" icon="symbols/cross" text="Don't alter the colors, shape, dimensions, orientation, or spacing of my logo." />
	<Implication slot="bad" icon="symbols/cross" text="Don't combine other words, design elements, or other logos with my logo." />
	<Implication slot="bad" icon="symbols/cross" text="Don't use any of my trademarks, logos, designs/artwork (including blog thumbnails), without prior written permission. " />
</Implications>

Still don't know, da wae? Need clarification? If so, **please don't hesitate** to email legal@ncp.dev to get further insight on how to use my logo properly to avoid any legal trouble. Speaking of which, **any person(s)** who are caught using my logo whilst not following these guidelines defined throughout the page, will be contacted privately via email from legal@ncp.dev or physically mailed a cease-and-desist letter (once the trademark is registered). If actions aren't taken to **eliminate** the unauthorized use of my trademark (within the timeframe set within the notice), legal action will be pursued to **protect and ensure my trademark**.

I've spent **thousands of hours making my software**, building my brand, and trying to create an experience **for everyone**. When someone is trying to steal that from me, I'll do everything in my power to **ensure**, **protect**, and **solidify** my brand. No matter if it's a *business or an individual*, the act of stealing and passing off work as your own is wrong in every way. I'll be actively tracking down such people, but if you find someone who is using my logo or has created anything that would confuse you because of their similarities, please contact legal@ncp.dev.

## My Signature 
**Under no circumstances**, should my signature be used to *replace* or *represent* my brand or logo. My signature is only used in special situations and is only to be used by myself. No one knows me by my signature anyway, so you're **required to use my logo**.

<Signature padding={12.5} />
